 _"The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate."_ - Thomas Jefferson

<br />

## Purpose: 
Informing the Texas electorate. 

## Reason:
Voting drives are nice, but getting uninformed people to cast ballots is not helping anyone. Voters need a _quick_, _user-friendly_ way to tell who a politician really is.

Who has the time to search for hours and hours through newspapers and online articles in the (possibly vain) hope of finding unbiased information on each and every candidate?

Voters need to know:
1. who is paying the politician off (campaign finance records).
1. how the politician voted (voting records).

By putting these two pieces of information together in a succinct mobile platform, we can turn uninformed voters into informed voters.
